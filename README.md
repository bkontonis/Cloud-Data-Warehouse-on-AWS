# Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. I'll be able to test my database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.

In this project, I'll apply what I've learned on data warehouses and AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. To complete the project, I will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

# Project Datasets
I'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
- Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json` <br>
`song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

`{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json` <br>
`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

# Solution
Using the song and event datasets, I'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis.
This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
   - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

# DWH configurations and SETUP
## step 1
- Create a new IAM user in your AWS account.
- Give it AdministratorAccess and Attach policies
- Use access key and secret key to create clients for EC2, S3, IAM, and Redshift.

## Step 2
- Create an IAM Role that makes Redshift able to access S3 bucket (ReadOnly)

## Step 3
- Create a RedShift Cluster and get the DWH_ENDPOIN(Host address) and DWH_ROLE_ARN and fill the config file.


# ETL Pipeline
- Created tables tables to store the data from S3 buckets.
- Loading the data from S3 buckets to staging tables in the Redshift Cluster.
- Inserted data into fact and dimension tables from the staging tables.

The project includes four files:
- `create_table.py` is where I create the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift.
- `etl.py` is where I load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process that data into the analytics tables on Redshift.
- `sql_queries.py` is where I define the SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.

# How to run
Execute files on terminal in the below order each time before pipeline:

1. create_tables.py
   `python3 create_tables.py`

2. etl.py
   `python3 etl.py`
